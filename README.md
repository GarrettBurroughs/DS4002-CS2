This repository contains the project overview, deliverable, data, and reference materials necessary to complete a data science case study analyzing the script of The Office

## Important Information
An overview of the case study, as well as a rubric, and additional references can be seen in the `Project Outline and Rubric.pdf` file in the root folder of the repostory. This should be the starting point when conducting the case study

## Reference Materials
The materials folder contains two sections
- A blog posts folder which contains blog posts of written analyses of the office
