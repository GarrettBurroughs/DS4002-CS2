# DS4002-CS3

This repository contains the study, deliverable, data, and reference materials necessary to complete the Case Study.
## Important Information
An overview of the case study, as well as a rubric, and additional references can be seen in the `Project Outline and Rubric.pdf` file. This should be the starting point when conducting the case study

## Data

The necessary data is located in the "DATA" folder. The data is pre-cleaned and processed, and in a .rda format, which can be readily loaded into R. A script for loading the data into Python is contained in the `materials/reference_scripts` folder.

## Reference Materials
The materials folder contains two sections
- A blog posts folder which contains blog posts of written analyses of the office
- A reference scripts folder which should help you load the data in R and Python to perform analysis
